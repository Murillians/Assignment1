(b) How many commits have been done to the repository (not only by you, but by
anyone) so far? Write the git command you used to get this information (4 points)
5, git log-pretty=oneline

(c) When was the .gitignore file modified last? Write the git command you used
to get this information (4 points)
the .gitignore file was last modified 1/10/19 (commit 69281a35557fd1226cbfc11428068c5d8bcf8466)
I used git log .gitignore to see this

(d) Mention two reasons why branches are used in a Git repository (4 points)

A branch can let you have a "Stable" release branch that has only bug fixes/stable releases and a 
dev release that lets you implement new features and play with them

keeping a clean master branch can also let other people start programming on an project
 and not need to worry about new changes made on a different branch

(e) What is the difference between git log and git status? (4 points)
git log shows you all previous commits to a repo while git status shows current status
(if you're up to date on your branch, changes not committed) 

(f) What command would you use to see the commits where “Weapon.h” was one
of the committed files? (4 points)
git log --follow Weapon.h
(g) What command would you use to see the commits whose commit message
contains the word “file”? (4 points)
git log --grep="file"

(h) In the context of object-oriented programming (I) What is inheritance? (II)
What is polymorphism? (III) What is encapsulation? (6 points)

I.Inheritance is when a class derives/extends another class and as a result inherits the traits(methods/variables/etc.) of the class it extends
II. Polymorphism allows us to support the same methods gained through inheritance through different means.
ex. a car class might have a weight method but a semi truck that derives that might have a weight method that factors if it has a trailer or not
III. Encapsulation is used to control user/derived class access to class data.
